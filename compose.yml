networks: # defining user defined network adds DNS by name of the service resolver for your services
  bridge-network:
    driver: bridge
  host-network: # Directly connected to host network and no need to expose ports. Useful for VPN: Wire guard or Kamailio
    driver: host # driver means network type. you can not have 2nd host driver network as Docker by default has one created already. Thus you would need just to use it instead of creating new network. Just add: network_mode: host under your container
  macvlan-network: # Directly connected to router and have their own ip addresses and acting like virtual machines, and you have to enable promiscuous option on host and router. on host: sudo ip link set <lan name> promisc and in virtual box and NO DHCP
    driver: macvlan
    # parent=your lan name
  ipvlan-network: # like macvlan, but they allow to host to share their mac address for all ip address
    driver: ipvlan
